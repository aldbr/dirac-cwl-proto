label: "Monte Carlo Pi Approximation Workflow"
doc: >
  This workflow approximates the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method.
  It generates random points in a square and calculates how many fall within
  a unit circle inscribed in the square.

# Define the inputs of the workflow
inputs:
  num-points:
    type: int
    doc: "Number of random points to generate for the simulation"
    # This number must be big to force the whole simulation+gather take
    #  a fair amount of time.
    #
    # - If it's too little, it would be difficult to differentiate between
    #  a parallel and a sequetial workflow.
    # - If it's too large, the test will take too long to complete.
    #
    # 10.000.000 points returned reasonable results, having a good balance
    #  between the previously mentioned issues
    default: 10000000

# Outputs for this test are not necessary
outputs: []

# Define the steps of the workflow
#  Two independent groups of steps (simulate+gather) to force parallel
#  execution. Sequential execution time should take aproximately twice
#  the time of a parallelly executed one.
steps:
  # Group 1
